Array-GroupBy version 0.0.3

Array::GroupBy supplies igroup_by() which returns an iterator which, when
called, returns sub-arrays of a given array which are "equal" as determined by
a user-supplied boolean function. The name is inspired by the SQL "GROUP BY"
clause.

It also supplies two convenince routines str_row_equal() and
num_row_equal() which compare 1-D arrays (or rows, or lists) containing string or numeric
data, and possibly also undef values.
